			<!-- Paragraph about topic -->
				<p>Rehoboth Beach Delaware is a very fascinating place. It offers many activities for all age groups. There are many restaurants with amazing food and fun places for children to play around. The beach is very beautiful as well.</p>
				<p>Rehoboth Beach is a great place to take your family and friends. It is very safe with many police officers at night and lifeguards during the day. During the day you can play at the beach and wander around the many shops and food places. At night, you can go out to the many nice restaurants this city has to offer.</p>
				<p>Your time at Rehoboth will be a time cherish for the rest of your life. Personally, my family has had a house there fo years. My parents have been going to Rehoboth all their life. They have exposed me to this lively, fun atmosphere. I cannot wait for the future where I will be able to expose this amazing place to my future family. I hope you can all enjoy this place as much as I do.</p>
